### Project Brief
For Front-end - 
I have used json-server for a dummy backend.
App.vue has Header , Navbar and Routers.
Created router to display the three types of card.
Default is the AllCard.vue component.

P.S : Few validations could have added. But i have ignored that for now. I have tried to acheive all the required tasks.

For Backend - There is backend.js file in the root directory. To run that use command - node backend.js in the root folder.
